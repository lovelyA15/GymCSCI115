    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Highschool in Canada</h2>
    <p>
        My time in high school in Canada was really something else. From all the hustle and bustle in the 
        halls to the super engaging classes, every single day brought new opportunities to grow and learn.
         One of the coolest things was how much emphasis they put on including everyone and appreciating
        differences. Getting to know folks from all kinds of backgrounds really opened my eyes and gave
        me a better understanding of the world. Both the teachers and other students made it such a
        supportive environment where I could freely explore my interests and talents. Whether I was
        joining clubs like debate team or volunteering in the community, I found tons of ways to build
        leadership skills and make a real difference. Plus, the academics pushed me hard to excel and
        go beyond what I thought I could do, really preparing me well for future schooling. Overall,
        my Canadian high school experience not just gave me important knowledge and abilities but
        also instilled values of empathy, resilience, and curiosity that still shape where I'm at personally
        and professionally today.

            My time in high school in Malaysia was truly unforgettable. It was a mix of learning about 
            different cultures, tough classes, and personal growth. Every day when I walked into the busy 
            school, I saw how many different ethnic groups and traditions lived together in harmony. The 
            school created a real sense of belonging for everyone and respect for our differences. 

            Outside the classroom, there were tons of clubs and sports that let me explore new things and 
            learn about myself. Whether I played on teams, joined cultural groups, or helped with community 
            service, it all taught me skills like working with others, being a leader, and not giving up 
            when things get hard.
            
            The classes pushed me academically but also sparked my curiosity to learn more. The teachers did 
            a great job teaching us, but also getting us excited about learning. They really supported me and 
            pushed me to do my best. Their encouragement helped me achieve more than I thought possible.
            
            Some of my best friends from high school feel like family to me. We experienced high school 
            ups and downs together as a tight community. I'll never forget special school events or just 
            chatting in the hallways. Those memories still inspire and make me feel nostalgic. 
            
            Overall, my high school experience in Malaysia was truly transformative. It shaped who I am, 
            opened my eyes to new things, and prepared me for life after. Most importantly, it instilled in 
            me qualities like resilience, empathy, and appreciation for other cultures - lessons that will 
            always guide me going forward.
