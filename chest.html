                    For this exercise there a few instructions to do it right and more importantly not
                    to injure yourself in the process. The first point is form, so do not place any weights
                    on the barbell and just lie down on the bench and place your eyes right under the bar.
                    Second, find the best possible point to place your hands on for some people is closer
                    grip and some people a larger grip but there are also lines on the barbell for you to 
                    adjust your hands on. Next pick up the barbell and lift it over your head, slowly bring 
                    the barbell down to touch the lower part of your chest while doing so inhale on your
                    way down and exhale when you push the barbell back up. Try a first set without any weights
                    to get the form correct and then slowly add weights to the amount you can lift gradually.
                    I have only learned by trying it out.

                    For this exercise there a few instructions to do it right and more importantly not
                    to injure yourself in the process. First, adjust the height of the the handles to the 
                    exact height of the middle of your chest, once adjusted do not pick any weights on it just
                    try it out without any weights. Then take a step forward with your dominant leg and have a 
                    firm grip on your posture. Next bring your arm forward into a semi-circular motion and have
                    handles touch lightly. Then go back to the starting postion but make sure not to go to far 
                    back where you place the weight back on, just stop right before that and do the movement 
                    again for a set of 8 reps and then place weights on gradually. Please try it out for yourselves
                    as have I for myself.
