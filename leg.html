                    For this exercise there a few instructions to do it right and more importantly not
                    to injure yourself in the process. First try to get the form of the exercise right 
                    due to the fact that squats can be extremely dangerous and deadly. Place the barbell
                    right by your shoulder height then get under the barbell with firm grip on the barbell 
                    and good footing as well. Have the barbell placed right exactly under your traps on your
                    back which would ensure a good position for the barbell not to hurt your neck or your 
                    back. Then lift up slowly to be able to take a few steps backwards and always try to 
                    have spotter if you fail to help you. Once you have a good footing bend down your legs 
                    into a 90 degree angle from your calves to your glutes and a straight back. Make sure 
                    that you are not bending your head forward due to the fact that the weight on your shoulder 
                    would pull you forward and cause you to fall on your neck. Once in that position push 
                    back up only using your glutes and hamstrings and not your upper body. Try it on without
                    any weight before proceeding to add more weights.

                    For this exercise there a few instructions to do it right and more importantly not
                    to injure yourself in the process. First adjust the seat for you to be able to sit 
                    comfortably and reach the pad easily with your legs. Once in place please avoid using 
                    any weights for the first set push onto the pad to raise it and be able to release the 
                    locks on the machine. Then slowly bring the pad down towards yourself and have a 90 
                    degree angle from your glutes to your calves. Once in that position then push the pad
                    back up slowly and continue for 7 more reps. Finally when you are comfortable with the 
                    exercise then add on weights gradually.
