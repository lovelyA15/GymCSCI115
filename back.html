                    For this exercise there a few instructions to do it right and more importantly not
                    to injure yourself in the process. First, start by adjusting the bench that you
                    are sitting on and make sure that it is adjusted to your height to be able to reach
                    the barbell with a little stretch. Then pick the lightest weight on the machine to
                    pull it down before doing so proceed to having a good shoulder wide grip on the 
                    barbell. Secondly, pull down the barbell towrds your chin and make sure to not go
                    any lower than that. The point of this exerciseis to work your lat muscles which are 
                    located on your back under your armpits. So make sure you try to squeeze well enough
                    under while pulling down and bringing the barbell back up slowly but not placing the 
                    weight back. Try the exercise for a set of 8 reps without weights first and then try 
                    it with weights gradually.

                    For this exercise there a few instructions to do it right and more importantly not
                    to injure yourself in the process. The point of this exercise is to work you lats and 
                    lower back more but your entire back would be at work for this exercise including your
                    biceps. Sit on the bench with your arms stretched a bit to grab the handle and then 
                    pull the handles towards yourself into your abdomen area but not quite touching it. 
                    Try it without any weights to be able to get the form correctly and then slowly bring
                    the handle away from yourself until right before you place down the weight to still
                    have resistance in play. Once you get comfortable after the first set add weights 
                    gradually to be able to lift more and activate your muscles more.
